    <h3>My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version. <br>
        Many local restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces. <br>
        It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer. Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side. Enjoy!  </h3>
